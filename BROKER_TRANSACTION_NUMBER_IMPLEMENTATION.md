# Broker-Specific Transaction Number Implementation

## Problem Statement
In the multi-user application, each broker maintains a physical book where they record transactions with sequential numbers starting from 1. When migrating to the digital system, brokers need to maintain their own transaction numbering sequence while the system maintains a global primary key for database integrity.

## Solution Overview
Implemented a dual-numbering system:
1. **Global Primary Key**: `ledgerDetailsId` - Auto-incremented database primary key
2. **Broker Transaction Number**: `brokerTransactionNumber` - Broker-specific sequential number starting from 1

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Changes
- Added `broker_transaction_number` column to `ledger_details` table
- Created unique index on `(broker_id, broker_transaction_number)` to prevent duplicates
- Migration script handles existing data by assigning sequential numbers per broker

### 2. Entity Updates
**LedgerDetails.java**
```java
@Column(name = "broker_transaction_number", nullable = false)
private Long brokerTransactionNumber;
```

### 3. Repository Methods
**LedgerDetailsRepository.java**
- `findByBrokerIdAndTransactionNumberWithAllRelations()` - Find transaction by broker-specific number
- `findMaxTransactionNumberByBrokerId()` - Get highest transaction number for a broker

### 4. Service Layer
**LedgerDetailsServiceImpl.java**
- Auto-generates next transaction number during creation
- New methods to fetch by transaction number:
  - `getLedgerDetailByTransactionNumber()`
  - `getOptimizedLedgerDetailByTransactionNumber()`

### 5. Controller Endpoints
**LedgerDetailsController.java**
- `GET /getLedgerDetailsByTransactionNumber` - Fetch by transaction number
- `GET /getOptimizedLedgerDetailsByTransactionNumber` - Optimized fetch by transaction number

### 6. DTO Updates
**OptimizedLedgerDetailsDTO.java**
- Added `brokerTransactionNumber` field for API responses

## API Usage Examples

### Create Transaction (Auto-assigns transaction number)
```http
POST /BrokerHub/LedgerDetails/createLedgerDetails
```
Response includes the assigned `brokerTransactionNumber`

### Fetch by Transaction Number
```http
GET /BrokerHub/LedgerDetails/getLedgerDetailsByTransactionNumber?transactionNumber=10&brokerId=1
```

### Fetch Optimized by Transaction Number
```http
GET /BrokerHub/LedgerDetails/getOptimizedLedgerDetailsByTransactionNumber?transactionNumber=10&brokerId=1
```

## Benefits
1. **Broker Familiarity**: Each broker sees their familiar numbering (1, 2, 3...)
2. **Data Integrity**: Global primary key ensures database consistency
3. **Multi-tenant Safe**: Transaction numbers are isolated per broker
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality remains unchanged
5. **Performance**: Indexed for fast lookups by transaction number

## Migration Steps
1. Run the migration script: `broker_transaction_number_migration.sql`
2. Deploy the updated application code
3. Verify transaction numbering works correctly for each broker

## Verification
After migration, each broker will have:
- Transaction numbers starting from 1
- Sequential numbering without gaps
- Ability to search by their familiar transaction numbers
- Complete isolation from other brokers' numbering

This implementation perfectly addresses the broker's need to maintain their familiar book-style transaction numbering while ensuring system integrity and multi-tenant isolation.
