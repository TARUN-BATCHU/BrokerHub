# Bulk Bill Generation Fix Documentation

## Issue Fixed
The bulk bill generation API was not properly tracking documents and the user was using the wrong endpoint format.

## Root Cause
1. **Wrong API Usage**: User called `/bulk-bills/users/8` expecting to generate bills for user ID 8, but this endpoint expects a request body with user IDs and treats `8` as financial year ID.
2. **Async Document Tracking**: Documents were created asynchronously, causing a delay in appearing in the status API.
3. **Missing Single User Endpoint**: No dedicated endpoint for single user bulk bill generation.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added New Endpoint
```
POST /BrokerHub/Brokerage/bulk-bills/user/{userId}/{financialYearId}
```
This endpoint allows generating bulk bills for a single user without requiring a request body.

### 2. Synchronous Document Creation
- Documents are now created synchronously before starting async processing
- This ensures immediate visibility in the status API
- Document ID is returned in the response for tracking

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Better logging and error tracking
- Proper document status updates on failure
- Success/failure counts in logs

## API Usage Examples

### Single User Bulk Bill (NEW)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/BrokerHub/Brokerage/bulk-bills/user/8/2023"
```

### Multiple Users Bulk Bill (EXISTING)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/BrokerHub/Brokerage/bulk-bills/users/2023" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "[8, 15, 23]"
```

### Check Status
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/BrokerHub/Documents/status"
```

### Download Document
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/BrokerHub/Documents/download/{documentId}"
```

## Response Format

### Bulk Bill Generation Response
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Request processed successfully",
  "data": "Bulk bill generation started for 1 user (Document ID: 123)"
}
```

### Status API Response
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Documents retrieved successfully",
  "data": [
    {
      "documentId": 123,
      "broker": { ... },
      "user": null,
      "financialYearId": 2023,
      "documentType": "BULK_USER_BILLS",
      "fileName": null,
      "filePath": "bills/10/2023/selected/",
      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "createdAt": "2025-01-27T10:30:00",
      "completedAt": "2025-01-27T10:31:00",
      "city": null,
      "userIds": "8"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Document Status Flow
1. **GENERATING**: Document is being processed
2. **COMPLETED**: Document is ready for download
3. **FAILED**: Document generation failed
4. **DOWNLOADED**: Document has been downloaded (excluded from status API)

## Testing the Fix

1. **Test Single User**: Use the new endpoint `/bulk-bills/user/8/2023`
2. **Check Status**: Call `/Documents/status` immediately after - should see GENERATING status
3. **Wait for Completion**: Status should change to COMPLETED when done
4. **Download**: Use the document ID to download the generated files
