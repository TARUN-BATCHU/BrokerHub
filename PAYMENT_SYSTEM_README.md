## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### 1. Execute Database Scripts
```sql
-- Run the database_tables_creation.sql file
mysql -u root -p brokerHub < database_tables_creation.sql
```

### 2. Verify Tables Created
```sql
SHOW TABLES LIKE '%payment%';
-- Should show: brokerage_payment, part_payment, pending_payment, 
--              receivable_payment, payment_transaction, receivable_transaction
```

## üîß Configuration

### Redis Configuration (Optional)
To enable Redis caching, uncomment in `application.properties`:
```properties
# Redis configuration
spring.data.redis.host=localhost
spring.data.redis.port=6379
spring.data.redis.timeout=60000ms
spring.data.redis.database=0
spring.cache.type=redis
spring.cache.redis.time-to-live=86400000
```

### Cache Configuration
The system uses in-memory caching by default. Caches include:
- `firmNames` - Firm names for search dropdown
- `brokeragePayments` - Brokerage payment data
- `pendingPayments` - Pending payment data
- `receivablePayments` - Receivable payment data
- `paymentDashboard` - Dashboard statistics

## üíº Business Logic

### Brokerage Calculation
```
Total Brokerage = (Sold Bags + Bought Bags) √ó Brokerage Rate
Discount = 10% of Total Brokerage
TDS = 5% of Total Brokerage
Net Brokerage = Total Brokerage - Discount - TDS
Pending Amount = Net Brokerage - Paid Amount
```

### Status Logic
- **PENDING**: pendingAmount > 0 && paidAmount == 0
- **PARTIAL_PAID**: pendingAmount > 0 && paidAmount > 0
- **PAID**: pendingAmount == 0
- **OVERDUE**: dueDate < currentDate && pendingAmount > 0

### Payment Methods
- CASH, BANK_TRANSFER, CHEQUE, UPI, NEFT, RTGS, ONLINE, OTHER

- **Basic Authentication** required for all endpoints
- **Username**: tarun
- **Password**: securePassword123
- **Base64 Encoded**: dGFydW46c2VjdXJlUGFzc3dvcmQxMjM=

### Authorization
- Broker ID validation ensures users can only access their own data
- Input validation prevents SQL injection and other attacks

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Database Indexes
- Composite indexes on frequently queried columns
- Foreign key indexes for join performance
- Status and date-based indexes for filtering

### Caching Strategy
- **Cache Duration**: Configurable (default: in-memory)
- **Cache Keys**: Broker-specific for data isolation
- **Cache Invalidation**: Automatic on data updates

### Query Optimization
- Fetch joins to reduce N+1 queries
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Efficient filtering and sorting

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Notifications** - WebSocket-based payment alerts
2. **Payment Reminders** - Automated email/SMS reminders

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify MySQL is running
   - Check connection settings in application.properties

2. **Cache Issues**
   - Clear cache using refresh endpoints
   - Restart application if needed

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Check database indexes
   - Monitor query execution times
   - Consider enabling Redis for production

## üìû Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify database table structure
3. Test with provided sample data
4. Review API documentation for correct usage
