# Bulk Upload Fixes - Client Issues Resolution

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Phone Number Made Non-Mandatory ✅
- **Issue**: Phone numbers were required for all merchant uploads
- **Fix**: Removed phone number validation from mandatory fields
- **Impact**: Merchants can now be uploaded without phone numbers

### 2. Redis Connection Errors Fixed ✅
- **Issue**: Application failed when Redis was not available locally
- **Fix**: Added fallback to in-memory caching when Redis is unavailable
- **Solutions Provided**:
  - Automatic fallback to simple cache when Redis connection fails
  - Reduced Redis timeout to fail fast (2 seconds instead of 60 seconds)
  - Created `application-no-redis.properties` for Redis-free environments

### 3. Hibernate Session Errors Fixed ✅
- **Issue**: "could not initialize proxy" errors during bulk operations
- **Fix**: Added proper transaction management and error handling
- **Impact**: Bulk upload operations now handle database sessions properly

## How to Run Without Redis

### Option 1: Use the No-Redis Profile
```bash
java -jar brokerageapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=no-redis
```

### Option 2: Modify application.properties
Change this line in `application.properties`:
```properties
# From:
spring.cache.type=redis

# To:
spring.cache.type=simple
```

### Option 3: Install Redis (Recommended for Production)
1. Download Redis for Windows from: https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases
2. Install and start Redis service
3. Use the default configuration

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Test Phone Number Fix**:
   - Upload an Excel file with some rows having empty phone numbers
   - These rows should now process successfully

2. **Test Redis Fallback**:
   - Stop Redis service (if running)
   - Upload merchants - should work with in-memory cache
   - Check logs for "using in-memory cache as fallback" message

3. **Test Session Handling**:
   - Upload a large Excel file (100+ rows)
   - All valid rows should process without "proxy initialization" errors

## Error Messages You Should No Longer See

- ❌ `Missing mandatory fields: phoneNumbers (value: [])`
- ❌ `Error processing user - Unable to connect to Redis`
- ❌ `could not initialize proxy [com.brokerhub.brokerageapp.entity.Broker#1] - no Session`

## Performance Notes

- **With Redis**: Better performance, shared cache across instances
- **Without Redis**: Slightly slower, but fully functional with in-memory cache
- **Recommendation**: Use Redis in production, in-memory cache for development/testing
