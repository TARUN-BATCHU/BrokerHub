## üîç Debugging Tips

1. **Check Application Logs**: Look for detailed error messages
2. **Verify Database**: Ensure tables are created and have data
3. **Test Authentication**: Verify Base64 encoding is correct
4. **Check Network**: Ensure application is accessible on port 8080
5. **Validate JSON**: Ensure request bodies are valid JSON
